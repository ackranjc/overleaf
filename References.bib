  abstract = {Dynamic rate-based and equilibrium models were developed for a packed
	reactive distillation column for the production of tert-amyl methyl
	ether (TAME). The two types of models, consisting of differential
	algebraic equations, were implemented in gPROMS and dynamic simulations
	were carried out to study the dynamic behaviour of reactive distillation
	of the TAME system. The dynamic responses predicted by the two types
	of models are similar in general, with some differences in steady-state
	values. The influence of manipulated variables, such as distillate
	flow rate, reflux ratio, and reboiler duty, on the dynamic responses
	of the controlled variables (reactant conversion and product purity)
	was studied. The dynamic response of reactant conversion is very
	nonlinear and unconventional, but the response of product purity
	is well approximated by a linear first-order differential equation.
	The CPU time required to complete a dynamic simulation of the rate-based
	model is at least an order of magnitude higher than that for the
	equilibrium model. Therefore, the dynamic rate-based model is much
	more complicated than the equilibrium model, and simplification of
	the rate-based model is necessary for the implementation of model-based
	control. A new approach was proposed to simplify the dynamic rate-based
	model by assuming that the mass transfer coefficients are time invariant.
	This approach was demonstrated to be superior to the conventional
	simplification methods. It can reduce the number of equations by
	up to two-thirds and still accurately predicts the dynamic behaviour.}

	fuel additive, through reactive distillation (RD) is an attractive
	route, while its operation and control are exceptionally difficult
	due to its functional combination and complex dynamics. Modern control
	technology greatly relies on good process models, while a reasonable
	RD model is too complex for control design. Moreover, RD contains
	considerable uncertainties that cannot be well described in process
	modelling. Alleviating the model requirement, this work aims to maintain
	the product purity in RD of ETBE through developing a pattern-based
	predictive control (PPC) scheme. Process dynamics, control structure,
	nonlinear transformation, feature pattern extraction, and pattern-based
	prediction and its incorporation with a conventional linear controller
	are discussed. Case studies show the effectiveness of the proposed
	method.},
