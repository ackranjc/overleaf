\chapter[Demonstration of Tables]{Demonstration of Tables}
\label{cha:cha4}

This is Chapter \ref{cha:cha4}. We will demonstrate how to present results in tables. It is not difficult but need to practice. 

The materials shown below is taken from my own PhD thesis. For simplicity, I do not cite any reference here.

\section[Task Decomposition with Fixed Periods]{Task Decomposition with Fixed Control Periods}

To employ the hierarchical feedback scheduling proposed in this work, we first develop a new task model in which each of the original six control tasks is decomposed into two subtasks: data acquisition and QoC evaluation, and control computation and output. Without loss of the generality, the settings of the decomposed tasks and their priorities are shown in Table \ref{tab:taskmodel}.

Control periods are the same as those in Table ...(omitted...). Priority levels are valid only for FP scheduling.}

We have tested the new task model, in which the original six tasks are decomposed into twelve subtasks, under fixed task periods and FP.
