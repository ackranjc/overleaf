\section{Summary of the Research}  

This ``qutthesis.sty'' \LaTeX~ package is easy to use. Thus, it is recommended to you to make your thesis writing much easier. In particular, you do not need to worry about the format and layout of your thesis; this package will look after all those aspects for you. 


%===============================
\section{Recommendations} 

This package may not always be compatible with other packages. But I do not have time to make a comprehensive testing. Therefore, when using any other packages, check if there is any problem. Keep in mind that we have some declarations in ``Abstract''. Please do have a look at those declarations.
